# QueryAI - An AI Mentor🤖
QueryAI is a GenAI-powered assistant that helps users connect with the kind of mentor they need instantly.  Users specify the type of mentor they're looking for, and then interact with an intelligent AI chatbot that mimics helpful guidance and domain expertise.

🎯 This is a hands-on practice project as part of my learning journey into the Generative AI domain.

### ✅ Phase 1: Agent Built
In this phase, I've built the core AI agent using:

- LangGraph: for creating a stateful, multi-step AI agent
- Integrated Tavily for real-time search
- Connected to Groq & OpenAI models for smart responses

 ### 🚀 What’s next:
 
 Backend API using FastAPI
 Frontend interface using Streamlit
 (... maybe more as I learn 👍🏻)
